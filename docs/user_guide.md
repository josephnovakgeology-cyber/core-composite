# Overview
If you are struggling to figure out how to install Core Composite, please check out the installation guide :)

This doc will walk you through how to use the three major tools within Core Composite:

**1) CorePhotoDigitizer** is an interactive GUI for processing legacy core photographs from the DSDP, ODP, and IODP contained within the `image.py` module. 
CorePhotoDigitizer allows geoscientists to extract L*, a*, and b* from analog and digital core photos, which is especially useful when working on drilling sites with no other useful archived stratigraphic information. 
CorePhotoDigitizer also allows users to convert L* values to % reflectance. 

**2) CompositeBuilder** is an algorithm that takes new or published affine shifts and uses them as the basis for automated centimeter-scale dynamic stretching or squeezing of off-splice drilling materials so that they are aligned to the main composite section for a set of parallel boreholes within the `builder.py` module. 
This algorithm is particularly useful for maximizing the scientific lifespan of very heavily sampled drill sites with preexisting composite stratigraphies and age models that need to be applied to off-splice cores that still have unsampled material.

**3) SpliceBuilderGUI** is an interactive GUI that enables users to generate new composite sections from physical properties data within the `gui.py` module. 

## Extracting color data from core photos: CorePhotoDigitizer
CorePhotoDigitizer is set up to convert the .pdf core photos from the DSDP / ODP / IODP database to .jpg format prior to image extration. 
A demo version of the script that implements CorePhotoDigitizer is included in the "demos" folder. 
The script needs to be in the same folder as the .pdfs of the core photos and requires a supporting file that includes the core section summary from the preliminary report. 

### Finding Core Photos in the Janus Database
The ODP Janus web database stores all of the data from legacy cores that was produced by Shipboard Scientific Parties. It can be accessed here: [Janus](https://www-odp.tamu.edu/database/).

Click the highlighted link to access the database from the main webpage.

From there, you can access the data from each DSDP, ODP, or IODP leg by clicking the Report number at the top of each column on the database, highlighted in the image below. Go ahead and click on Leg 145.

This will take you to the data for all of the drill sites from that DSDP, ODP, or IODP Leg. From here, click on the number of the drill site you are studying. We are going to look at Site 887 as an example, highlighted in the image below.

Great. You are now looking at all of the data archived by DSDP, ODP, or IODP from your drill site. The numbers correspond to the number of data points from each hole of a given data type. Click on the numbers to see the data. Here, we are going to click on the photos for Site 887 Hole A.

Each of the image links will take you to the core photos, which you can download as a .pdf file. Core composite will convert them to .jpg format for you later, so do not worry about that.
